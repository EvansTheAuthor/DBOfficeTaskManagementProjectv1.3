# Project Name: DBOfficeTaskManagement
### Version: 1.2.0

### Updates:

- Added "Update" and "Delete" buttons to the Employee Table Frame. You can now easily edit data by selecting an entry and clicking the corresponding button to either update or delete it.
- Removed the "Update" button from the Employee Add Frame. The editing process has been moved to the Employee Table Frame as mentioned above.
- Added a Search Bar with an enhanced main feature in the Employee Table Interface. You can now search for an employee by typing just a few letters of their name. (Currently, this feature is only available for searching by name. Searching by address, phone, or other individual data will be improved soon.)

### Work in Progress:

- Developing a "New Team Creation" feature.
- Fixing minor bugs that appear when accessing the Team Member Editing Frame.
- The application's UI is under development and planned as a long-term ongoing project.
